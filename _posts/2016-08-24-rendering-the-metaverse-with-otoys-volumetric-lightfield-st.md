  Digital lightfields are a cutting-edge technology that can render
  photorealistic VR scenes, and Otoy has been a pioneer of the rendering and
  compression techniques to deal with the massive amounts of data required to
  create them. Their OctaneRender is GPU-based, physically correct renderer that
  has been integrated into 24 special effects industry tools with support for
  Unity and Unreal Engine on the way.
