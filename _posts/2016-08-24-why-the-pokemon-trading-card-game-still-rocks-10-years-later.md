      British shoppers used credit and debit cards in 1.1 billion transactions
      in May as the adoption of contactless payments helped drive the use of
      plastic rather than cash. In the same month last year, cards were used 991
      million times, indicating use of cards has risen by 10pc in just one year,
      according to numbers from the UK Cards Association.

  In the competitive field of trading card games, few stick around long enough
  to make any sort of lasting impression, especially those that spawned from
  existing entertainment franchises. And continuing to thrive in 2016 means
  competing with far more affordable electronic card games like Hearthstone:
  Heroes of Warcraft, which leads a $1.2 billion market.
